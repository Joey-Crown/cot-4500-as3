# COP4500 Numerical Calculus Assignment 3

This application was built with `Python` using the `NumPy` library.

## Purpose 

This repository is here to demonstrate an understanding of initial-value problems and solving linear systems using various 
numerical methods. The algorithms used to solve the problems in this assignment include Euler's method, the Runge-Katta 
method, Gaussian elimination, LU factorization, and determining special types of matrices.

## Requirements

Project was made in a development environment using `Python 3.9`

### pip
All package dependencies are included in `requirements.txt`

Install necessary packages using `pip` with the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
